# Data analysis for supermarket POS
This project involves analyzing point-of-sale (POS) data collected from a supermarket & provides an interactive interface.   
The goal is to clean the data, explore key insights, and extract meaningful patterns using various data analysis techniques.

# What this project includes:
-*Data Cleaning*:  
  Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data for analysis.

- *Data Visualization*:  
  Using graphs and charts to represent trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

- *Association Rules*:  
  Discovering relationships between items (e.g. market basket analysis).

- *Clustering*:  
  Grouping customers/products based on purchase behavior and features.
  # Interactive Dashboard Includes:
- *File Upload*:  
  Users can upload a .csv dataset directly into the app.
  
- *Data Cleaning Button*:  
  Automatically cleans the dataset by handling missing values and formatting.

- *Data Visualization*:  
  Displays dynamic charts and summaries based on uploaded data.

- *Clustering Section*:  
  - Input field to specify the number of clusters (K)
  - Runs clustering and displays grouped results

- *Association Rules*:  
  - User inputs for support and confidence thresholds  
  - Generates association rules between products

# Tools & Technologies Used:
- *R programming language*
- ggplot2 for data visualization
- arules for association rule mining
- cluster for clustering analysis
- R Shiny* for the web interface
